A CLI for controlling the power state of the Lepro S1 LED 5m strip.
The goal is to automatically control the state of the strip, e.g.
combine this script with shell:startup to activate the strip on boot.

Usage:
    py main.py --update       # Setup the replay. Run this first.
    py main.py --power on/off # Toggle the strip power.

I originally intended to reverse engineer the whole coms between the
Lepro app and the strip for advanced color control, but screw this,
I don't have time for a stupid strip that I don't even use that often.
The Lepro app is very annoying to use, and the data structure looks
encrypted or ofbuscated or I don't fucking know I am not a bluetooth
dev, so BLE packet replay it is.

Every time you cut power to the strip, you need to toggle the power
switch a few times on your phone in the app (end with ON), then plug
the phone to your PC and run the update command.

The update command assumes your phone:
- Has bluetooth HCI logs enabled;
- Accepts ADB connections from your PC systematically;
- Is rooted and the ADB shell has root permissions;
- The HCI file is located in /data/log/bt (for most Samsung phones).
